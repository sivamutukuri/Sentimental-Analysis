# Sentiment Analysis Project

# Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. It preprocesses textual data, extracts features using TF-IDF, and employs deep learning models with PyTorch to classify sentiments.

# Features

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Sentiment classification using machine learning models

Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

# Technologies Used

Python (for scripting and data handling)

NLTK & spaCy (for natural language processing)

Scikit-learn (for feature extraction and ML model training)

PyTorch (for deep learning-based sentiment analysis)

Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

#EDA

* This chart displays the relationship between user age groups and the time they post tweets.

* The x-axis represents different age groups (0-20, 21-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60-70, 70-100).

* The y-axis represents the count of tweets.

* Different colors signify different times of the day (morning, noon, night).

* The distribution appears uniform, suggesting similar tweet activity across all age groups for each time slot.
